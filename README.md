## Additions to existing repo

### experiments

Jupyter notebook and run statistics from a selection of experiments which were ran. Not all runs and no models are included for either clarity as this work is all preliminary or else due to storage constraints. 

Experiments were lengthy to complete and not done in such a way that statistics can be averaged across seeds. Models are accessible on my OneDrive so long as I have access to it.
